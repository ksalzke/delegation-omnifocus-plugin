# About

This is an Omni Automation plug-in bundle for OmniFocus that provides 'waiting for' and 'follow up' actions. Further details of these actions are provided below.

# Installation & Set-Up

1. Click on the green `Clone or download` button above to download a `.zip` file of all the files in this GitHub repository.
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Open the configuration file located at `Resources/delegationConfig.js` and make any changes needed to reflect your OmniFocus set-up. Further explanations of the options are included within that file as comments.
4. Rename the entire folder to anything you like, with the extension `.omnifocusjs`
5. Move the resulting file to your OmniFocus plug-in library folder.

# Actions

This plug-in contains the following two actions:

## Waiting For
This action can be run on one or more selected tasks and creates a new task after the selected task(s) whose:
* name is the same as the original task's name, but with `Waiting for: ` prepended
* tag is the `waitingTag` specified in the configuration file (currently this is `Activity Type: ‚è≥ Waiting` by default).

Note that any project tags will also be inherited.

## Follow Up
This action can be run on one or more selected tasks.

It first prompts the user for a contact method to be used to follow up on the selected task(s). These are taken from the `followUpMethods` variable in the configuration file and by default are any children of the `Activity Type: Contact` tag.

Then, for each selected task:
1. If the task is not already contained within such an action group, creates a sequential action group with the same name as the selected task(s).
2. Moves the task into the parent sequential action group.
3. Creates a new task before the original task (and inside the action group) whose: 
* name is the same as the original task's name, but with  `Follow up: ` prepended in place of `Waiting for: `.
* tags are the same as the original task's tags, but with the selected follow-up method added and any waiting tags (the tag specified as `waitingTag` in the configuration file as well as any of its children) removed
* note is a link to the original task in the format `[FOLLOWUPON: omnifocus///task/taskid]`

Note that the parent sequential action group is created so that the 'waiting for' task only becomes available after the follow-up task has been completed (or dropped or deleted), even in a parallel project or single-action list.

# Functions

This plugin also contains the following function within the `delegationLib` library:

## noteFollowUp

This function takes a task as input and if the task begins with `follow up` or `Follow up` it looks in the note of the task for a `[FOLLOWUPON]` tag of the type created by the `Follow Up` action.

If one is found it adds a note to that original task indicating that the task has been followed up on the current time and date.

It is hoped that in the future this will be able to be run automatically on the completion of a task, but currently the intention is that it will be run manually from a 'custom complete' action. It can be used as follows (given a task stored in variable `task`):

```
delegationPlugin = PlugIn.find("com.KaitlinSalzke.Delegation");
	if (delegationPlugin !== null) {
		delegationPlugin.library("delegationLib").noteFollowUp(task);
	}
```

An example can be seen in the ['Custom Complete' action](https://github.com/ksalzke/miscellaneous-omnifocus-plugins/blob/master/customComplete.omnijs) in my [Miscellaneous OmniFocus Plugins](https://github.com/ksalzke/miscellaneous-omnifocus-plugins) repository.
